Report Error CiviCRM Extension
==============================

Sometimes CiviCRM can be real tough to debug. Especially when you are getting
fatal errors, but only by some users, and you can't recreate the problems.
This utility will send you a detailed email when a CiviCRM fatal error occurs.

* when the error was encountered
* which CiviCRM page threw the error 
* which logged-in user encountered the error
* full request parameters ("get")
* optionally the "post" data

The extension can also offer to try to resolve some common errors:

* For contribution pages where the session has expired or the contribution
  page URL is truncated, you can choose to gracefully redirect CiviCRM
  errors to the site CMS default page, a specific contribution page or not
  at all. You also have the option of not getting emails on contribution
  page redirects (since crawlers can make them rather frequent).
